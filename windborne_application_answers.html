        <h2>1. Semantle Strategy Guide</h2>
        <div class="answer">
            <p><strong>Understanding Semantle:</strong> Semantle is a word guessing game where you try to find a secret word. Unlike traditional word games, you don't get told if letters are correct—instead, you get a similarity score (0-100) that represents how semantically similar your guess is to the secret word based on word embeddings.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Strategy for Beginners:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start Broad:</strong> Begin with common, general words across different categories (e.g., "animal", "food", "emotion", "action") to establish a baseline and understand the semantic space.</li>
                <li><strong>Similarity Score:</strong> Higher scores mean you're closer semantically. If you get a score above 50, you're in the right conceptual neighborhood—try synonyms, related concepts, or words in the same category.</li>
                <li><strong>Think Conceptually:</strong> The game uses semantic similarity, not spelling. "Happy" and "joyful" are closer than "happy" and "happen", even though the latter shares more letters.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Hints Strategically:</strong> Don't be afraid to use hints. They can reveal words with high similarity scores, giving you anchor points to explore from.</li>
                <li><strong>Narrow Down:</strong> Once you have several high-scoring words, identify the common theme or category they share, then explore more specific terms within that domain.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>2. A Hobby I Love</h2>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>I'm passionate about playing pickleball! There's something incredibly satisfying about the combination of strategy, quick reflexes, and social connection that the game offers. Whether I'm playing a fast-paced singles match or a more tactical doubles game, the constant decision making, knowing when to dink, when to drive, and when to go for the smash keeps me fully engaged. I love how accessible the sport is while still offering endless room for improvement, and the community of players I've met through pickleball has been wonderful. The moment when you execute a perfect third-shot drop or win a long rally feels incredibly rewarding, and it's a hobby that keeps me active, sharp, and happy.</p>

        <h2>3. If I Could Land a Balloon Anywhere</h2>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>I would want to land a balloon in Disneyland, specifically right in the middle of "It's a Small World" during peak hours. Imagine the look on people's faces... It would be the most magical (and probably most disruptive) Disney experience ever! Plus, I'd get to skip the line.</p>
